# react-ts-component-lib
Easy setup for a complete component library across react/ts projects. For now just a really easy to use template, but react/typescript components can be added to project with `yarn add react-ts-component-lib` (when published) and will be updated with more complex components and fancier styling.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn storybook`

Runs the storybook locally, updates on save (webpack).


### `yarn build`

Distributes to "lib" folder (rollup).
